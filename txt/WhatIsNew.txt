* Crawler: Bugfix: The PoiMsExcelPreparator did not get on with all number and
  date formats.
* Crawler: The error log is now more detailed (with stacktraces).
* Crawler: Preparators are now encapsulated in own jars. Thus the regain.jar
  only contains what regain itself needs and preparators may be replaced more
  easily. Also other developers may provide preparators that can be mounted
  very easily.
  The configuration of the preparators is still in the CrawlerConfiguration.xml.
  But now not all preparators must be declared. The preparators are executed in
  the same order as they are configured, the unconfigured preparators afterwards.
* Desktop search: The desktop search now runs under Linux, too.
* Search: Bugfix: Files whichs URL contains a double slash (e.g. of network
  drives: //fileserver/bla/blubb) couldn't be loaded.
* Desktop search: Bugfix: At the search results umlauts were presentet wrong.
* Desktop search: On the status page a currently running index update can now be
  paused and an index update can be started.
* Crawler: Bugfix: The HtmlPraeparator did not get on with all files.


Version 1.1 Beta 2 on 2005-03-12
--------------------------------

* Crawler: The crawler now creates periodically so called breakpoint. When doing
  so the current state of the search index is copied into a separate directory.
  If the index update should be cancelled (e.g. if the computer is shut down),
  the crawler will go on from the last breakpoint.
* Desktop search: The status page now shows the timing results.


Version 1.1 Beta 1 on 2005-03-10
--------------------------------

* Desktop search: reagain now provides a desktop search besides the server
  search. The desktop searchs provides many features that makes the use as easy
  as winking:
    - An installer for Windows.
    - Integration in the task bar under Linux and Windows.
    - Configuration over the browser
    - Status monitoring over the browser
* Crawler: There is now a preparator for OpenOffice and StarOffice documents.
* All: Updated to the newest versions of the used projects.
* Crawler: Preparators are now configurable by the CrawlerConfiguration.xml.
* Search: The Search is now configured by the SearchConfiguration.xml, not the
  web.xml any more. There is only the path to the SearchConfiguration.xml
  any more.
* Search: The Search now provides URL rewriting. This way you can index
  documents in file://c:/www‑data/intranet/docs and show the documents in the
  browser as http://intranet.murfman.de/docs.
* Crawler: Auxiliary fields: The index may now be extended by auxiliary fields
  that are extracted from a document's URL.
  Example: Assumed you have a directory with a sub directory for every project.
  Then you can generate an auxiliary field with the project name. Doing so you
  get only documents from that directory when searching for
  "Offer project:otto23".
* Search: Advanced search: All values that are in the index for one field may
  now be provided as a combo box on the search page. Particularly together with
  auxiliary fields this is very useful.
* Search: Some browsers load for security reasons no file links from http pages.
  Thus all documents that are in the index are now provided over HTTP. Of corse
  at the desktop search these documents are only accessible from the local host.
* Crawler: The JacobMsWordPraeparator now regards styles. Thus it is possible
  to extract headlines that will be weight more when searching.
* Crawler: The JacobMsOfficePraparators are now able to extract the description
  fields (Title, author, etc.)
